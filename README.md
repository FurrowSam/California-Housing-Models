# Heart Disease Prediction
This repository explores different machine learning models for predicting heart disease using patient data from 2020 and 2022.

Project Structure:

Branches:
main: The main branch holds the core project files, including data, scripts, and documentation.
juan, robert, moez, sam: These branches represent individual member contributions containing scripts for their respective model explorations.
Data:
The data (details about format, location, and any data transformations can be added here) is used to train and evaluate the models.
Models:
Gradient Boosting
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
SVC (Linear)
Project Goals:

Compare and contrast the performance of different machine learning models in predicting heart disease.
Identify the most effective model for this specific task.
Key Findings:

The SVC (Linear) model achieved a 91% recall for positive heart disease results, indicating strong performance in identifying individuals with the condition.
Further Exploration:

Hyperparameter tuning to potentially improve model performance.
Feature engineering to extract additional insights from the data.
Ensemble learning by combining multiple models for enhanced prediction accuracy.
