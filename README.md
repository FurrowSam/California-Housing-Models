# Heart Disease Prediction
This repository explores different machine learning models for predicting heart disease using patient data from 2020 and 2022.

Project Structure:

Branches:
main: The main branch holds the core project files, including data, scripts, and documentation.
Juan-Fernando, Robert, Moez, and Sam: These branches represent individual member contributions containing scripts for their respective model explorations.

Data:
The data was sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease/data

Models:
Gradient Boosting (Juan-Fernando)
Logistic Regression (Robert)
Random Forest (Moez)
SVC 'Linear' (Sam)

Project Goals:
Compare and contrast the performance of different machine learning models in predicting heart disease.
Identify the most effective model for this specific task.

Key Findings:
The SVC model achieved a 91% recall for positive heart disease results on the 2020 data, indicating strong performance in identifying individuals with the condition.

Further Exploration:
Hyperparameter tuning to potentially improve model performance.
Feature engineering to extract additional insights from the data.
Ensemble learning by combining multiple models for enhanced prediction accuracy.
